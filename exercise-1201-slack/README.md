# Slack integration for Signal Query

Advanced Tutorial

## Overview

This exercise builds upon 06-support-triage and makes this exercise more realistic. 
In 06 we send a Signal via the CLI. In the real world this would likely be sent via
some client through a UI for the end-user.
In exercise 1201 we will integrate Slack as that Signal and learn several new 
concepts along the way.
