# Temporal Warmups - Learning Curriculum (Updated)

## Overview

A progressive series of hands-on exercises designed to build expertise with Temporal workflow orchestration through daily practice. Each exercise focuses on converting ordinary procedural code into durable Temporal workflows with proper activity separation, retry policies, and error handling.

**Goal:** Complete each exercise in approximately 1 hour, building speed and confidence over time across Python, Java, Go, and TypeScript.

**Brand Color:** `#AEB6D9` (Temporal's primary brand color)

---

## Common Type Serialization Issues (Exercises #1-4)

**CRITICAL:** Temporal's default JSON converter has limitations that affect all beginner exercises.

### What Works Out of the Box:
- ✅ Strings, integers, floats, booleans
- ✅ Lists, dicts
- ✅ Dataclasses (if all fields are serializable types)

### What DOES NOT Work:
- ❌ Enums (use `str` instead)
- ❌ datetime/date objects (use `str` in ISO 8601 format)
- ❌ Decimal types (use `float` instead)
- ❌ Custom classes (unless dataclass with serializable fields)

### Week 1-4 Strategy: Keep It Simple
```python
# ❌ Don't use in dataclasses
room_type: RoomType  # Enum
check_in: datetime   # datetime object
price: Decimal       # Decimal type

# ✅ Use simple types instead
room_type: str       # "standard", "deluxe", "suite"
check_in: str        # "2024-12-20" (ISO 8601: YYYY-MM-DD)
price: float         # 99.99
```

### Week 5+ Topic: Custom Data Converters
Once you master the basics, learn to build custom converters for Enums, Decimals, and complex types.

---

## Activity vs Workflow Logic - Decision Framework

When analyzing code for conversion to Temporal, use this framework:

### Should This Be WORKFLOW Logic?
- ✅ Pure calculations (no I/O)
- ✅ Conditional logic based on inputs
- ✅ Data transformations
- ✅ Input validation
- ❌ NO external system calls
- ❌ NO randomness or time-based operations

### Should This Be an ACTIVITY?
- ✅ Database reads/writes
- ✅ API calls to external services
- ✅ File I/O
- ✅ Email/SMS sending
- ✅ Anything with `time`, `random`, `datetime.now()`
- ✅ Anything that can fail due to external factors

### Examples from Exercise #3:

| Code | Location | Why? |
|------|----------|------|
| `nights = (check_out - check_in).days` | Workflow | Pure calculation from inputs |
| `total = base_price * nights` | Workflow | Deterministic arithmetic |
| `if nights >= 7: total *= 0.9` | Workflow | Deterministic conditional |
| `if not email or '@' not in email` | Workflow | Input validation |
| `check_room_availability()` | Activity | Reads external inventory system |
| `process_payment()` | Activity | Calls external payment gateway |
| `send_email()` | Activity | External email service (can fail) |

**Rule of thumb:** If you can write it as a pure function with no side effects, it belongs in the workflow.

## Week 1-2: Fundamentals

Focus on learning the basic workflow → activity pattern across multiple languages. Clean starting code, straightforward scenarios, emphasis on getting the pattern down.

### Exercise #1: User Registration ⭐⭐
**Language:** Python  
**Time:** ~1 hour  
**Concepts:** Basic workflow, activities, retries

**Scenario:** Simple 4-step user registration flow (validate, create user, send welcome email, send verification email).

**Learning Goals:**
- Separate workflow orchestration from activities
- Implement retry policies
- See automatic failure recovery
- Understand durability (workflow survives worker restarts)

**Key Takeaways:**
- Workflow vs Activity boundaries
- Deterministic vs non-deterministic code
- External state management (database)
- Basic retry policies

**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

### Exercise #2: Order Processing ⭐⭐⭐
**Language:** Python  
**Time:** ~3 hours (includes debugging)  
**Concepts:** Multiple activities, external state, debugging

**Scenario:** E-commerce order processing (validate, calculate total, process payment, reserve inventory, schedule shipment).

**Learning Goals:**
- Handle more complex state across multiple activities
- Remove naive retry logic and trust Temporal's retry policies
- Work with external state (inventory database, payment tracking)
- Debug complex Temporal errors systematically

**Key Takeaways:**
- Python version compatibility (3.9-3.10, NOT 3.14)
- Temporal's sandbox restrictions
- Dataclass serialization (use `float` not `Decimal`)
- `__pycache__` can cache old, broken code
- How to debug cryptic `os.stat` errors

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Non-deterministic imports in workflow.py
- Missing `await` on activity calls
- Wrong Python version
- Cached imports

**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

### Exercise #2.5: Email Verification ⭐
**Language:** Python  
**Time:** 20-45 minutes  
**Concepts:** Muscle memory, speed building

**Scenario:** Two-step email verification (generate token, send email).

**Learning Goals:**
- Build muscle memory for basic pattern
- Practice setup rhythm without debugging distractions
- Get comfortable with development loop
- Speed: Target under 30 minutes

**Key Takeaways:**
- Reinforce the basic pattern through repetition
- Build confidence and speed
- Clean, minimal exercise for practice

**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

### Exercise #3: Hotel Reservation ⭐⭐⭐
**Language:** Python  
**Time:** ~3 hours (includes business logic analysis)  
**Concepts:** Messy code refactoring, fallback patterns, architectural decisions

**Scenario:** Hotel booking with payment, room assignment, and confirmation (starting from messy 100+ line monolithic function).

**Learning Goals:**
- Refactor poorly organized code to Temporal patterns
- Make judgment calls about workflow vs activity boundaries
- Implement fallback notification patterns (email → SMS → manual)
- Understand when NOT to compensate (auxiliary failures vs business-critical)
- Handle type serialization constraints (Enum → str, datetime → str)

**Key Takeaways:**
- Breaking apart monolithic functions
- When calculations should be workflow logic vs activities
- Fallback patterns for non-critical operations
- When auxiliary failures (email) don't warrant compensation
- Type serialization: Enum/datetime don't serialize, use strings
- ISO 8601 date format requirements (zero-padded: `2024-07-12` not `2024-7-12`)

**The "Audit" Benefit:**
Converting legacy code to Temporal forces architectural clarity. You must answer:
- What's deterministic vs non-deterministic?
- What's core business logic vs external dependencies?
- Where are the failure boundaries?
- What failures are critical vs auxiliary?

This analysis adds time but provides architectural value beyond just learning Temporal.

**Common Issues:**
- `TypeError: Object of type RoomTypes is not JSON serializable` → Use `str` instead of Enum
- `ValueError: Invalid isoformat string: '2025-7-12'` → Use zero-padded dates: `'2025-07-12'`
- `TypeError: 'LoggerAdapter' object is not callable` → Use `activity.logger.info()` not `activity.logger()`
- Using `workflow.uuid4()` in client code → Use standard `uuid.uuid4()` instead

**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

### Exercise #4 (Optional): Multi-Language Rotation
**Languages:** Java or Go  
**Time:** ~1.5 hours  
**Concepts:** Same patterns, different syntax

**Scenario:** Pick Exercise #1, #2.5, or #3 and implement in Java or Go.

**Learning Goals:**
- Apply the same Temporal patterns in a different language
- Understand SDK differences
- Build cross-language fluency

**Key Differences to Learn:**
- **Java:** Interface-based design, activity stubs, builder patterns
- **Go:** Context everywhere, struct-based workflows, channels

---

## Fallback Patterns (Introduced in Exercise #3)

**Pattern:** Progressive degradation through multiple service channels

**Use Case:** Non-critical operations with multiple backup options

**Example from Exercise #3:**
```python
try:
    # Primary notification channel
    await workflow.execute_activity(send_email_notification, ...)
except ActivityError:
    # Fallback: Try SMS
    workflow.logger.warning("Email failed, trying SMS")
    try:
        await workflow.execute_activity(send_sms_notification, ...)
    except ActivityError:
        # Ultimate fallback: Manual intervention
        workflow.logger.warning("SMS failed, queuing for manual notification")
        await workflow.execute_activity(front_desk_confirmation, ...)
```

**Key Insight:** Don't fail the entire workflow for auxiliary failures. Degrade gracefully.

**Contrast with Compensation:**
- **Fallback:** Try alternative methods for same goal (notify customer via email → SMS → phone)
- **Compensation:** Rollback previous business steps (refund payment, release inventory)

**When to Use Fallback vs Compensation:**
- **Fallback:** Notification failures, optional integrations, non-critical features
- **Compensation:** Payment failures after inventory reserved, booking failures after payment processed

**Realistic Touch:** Cascading errors - some only appear after fixing previous ones

**Deliverable:** Working workflow + debugging process documentation

---

### Exercise #11: Workflow & Worker Versioning ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Language:** Python  
**Time:** ~2 hours  
**Concepts:** Safe deployments, backwards compatibility

**Scenario:** Production workflow needs a new activity added in the middle. Must support both old (in-flight) and new workflows.

---

### Exercise #13: Complex Multi-Service Orchestration ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Language:** Python (or multi-language)  
**Time:** 3-4 hours  
**Concepts:** Everything combined

**Scenario:** E-commerce checkout that coordinates: payment gateway, inventory system, shipping provider, notification service, fraud detection, loyalty points - with compensations, parallelization, and human approvals.

**Learning Goals:**
- Combine all learned patterns
- Handle real-world complexity
- Make architectural decisions
- Optimize for performance and reliability

**Patterns Used:**
- Parallel execution
- Sagas/compensations

---

### Exercise #14: Worker Optimization & Performance Tuning ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Language:** Python  
**Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Concepts:** Performance, timeouts, parallelization, worker configuration, resource management

**Scenario:** Production workflow that "works" but takes 5 minutes when it should take 30 seconds, times out randomly, and can't handle load.

**Problems to Diagnose & Fix:**
- Timeout misconfigurations (too short, too long, wrong hierarchy)
- Serial execution when should be parallel
- Worker configuration issues (too few/many concurrent tasks)
- Activity design problems (mega-activities blocking workers)
- Resource starvation (database connection exhaustion)
- No graceful degradation

**Learning Goals:**
- Understand timeout hierarchy (schedule-to-start, start-to-close, schedule-to-close)
- Activity heartbeats for long-running operations
- Parallelization strategies
- Worker configuration tuning
- Resource management (connection pooling, rate limiting)
- Monitoring & metrics
- **Claim check pattern for large payloads** (performance optimization)

**Performance Scenarios:**
- **The Slow Workflow:** 5 minutes → 30 seconds
- **The Overwhelmed Worker:** Crashes at 10 concurrent → handles 100+
- **The Timeout Spiral:** 30% timeout rate → <1%
- **The Database Bottleneck:** Connection pool exhausted → stable under 200 concurrent

**Claim Check Pattern:**
- Reduce workflow history: 50MB → 500KB
- Improve replay time: 10s → <1s
- Lower worker memory: 2GB → 200MB

---

## Common Mistakes (Updated)

1. **Importing `time`, `random`, `datetime.now()` in workflow.py**
2. **Forgetting `await` on activity calls**
3. **Passing mutable workflow state to activities**
4. **Activity functions with `self` parameter** (they're not methods)
5. **Missing activities in worker registration**
6. **Using `time.sleep()` instead of `await asyncio.sleep()`** in async activities
7. **Accessing dict keys on dataclass objects** (`item['sku']` vs `item.sku`)
8. **Using Enums/datetime in dataclasses** without custom data converter
   - Error: `TypeError: Object of type RoomType is not JSON serializable`
   - Fix: Use `str` for now, custom converter in Week 5+
9. **Non-zero-padded ISO dates**
   - Error: `ValueError: Invalid isoformat string: '2025-7-12'`
   - Fix: Use `'2025-07-12'` (zero-padded month/day: YYYY-MM-DD)
10. **Calling `activity.logger()` as function**
    - Error: `TypeError: 'LoggerAdapter' object is not callable`
    - Fix: `activity.logger.info()` not `activity.logger()`
11. **Using `workflow.uuid4()` in client code**
    - Error: `AttributeError` or context errors
    - Fix: Use standard `uuid.uuid4()` in client, `workflow.uuid4()` only in workflows
